# Characterization and Application of Android WiFi-RTT API

## ABSTRACT
## Indoor localization has been an active research area over the years. Since GPS signal is generally not available in indoor scenarios, researchers have been trying to utilize wireless signals such as Bluetooth or WiFi strength (RSSI) to indicate relative locality. While the wireless signal strength can be affected by lots of factors, the indicated locality could be inaccurate. Google announced in 2018 I/O that Android P would incorporate WiFi Fine Time Measurement (FTM) to enable an accurate distance measurement by round trip time(RTT) of WiFi signal. The advertised precision of measurements was up to one meter which made WiFi RTT a great candidate for future development. In this project, we are characterizing WiFi RTT performance in different testing scenarios and comparing between hardware devices. We also design a Proof-of-Concept application for parking lot navigation using the WiFi RTT. The rest of this report is constructed as follows: from section I to section II, we provide basic introduction and theoretical backgrounds of WiFi RTT; from section III to section IV, we introduce our experiment software and hardware setups; in section V, we analyze our collected data and in section VI, we introduce our Android application for finding car in parking lot. We show future work and conclusion in section VII and VIII.
